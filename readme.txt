Data on weather in Brzoskwinia is web-scraped on a daily basis from an airly webpage (https://airapi.airly.eu/v2/measurements/nearest?lat=50.096411&lng=19.718471&maxDistanceKM=5). New daily data is added to existing dataset. PM1, PM25 and PM10 average values at each hour are shown on plots as well as dependencies of PM2.5 and PM10 on temperature, pressure and humidity. Correlation matrix shows relations between values. Box plots of PM10 concentrations in humidity are created. Another plot shows daily exceedings of PM10 concentrations.
